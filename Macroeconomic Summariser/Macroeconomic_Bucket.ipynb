            "*   **Robust GDP Growth (7.4%) & Strong Manufacturing PMI (57.6):** Directly fuels increased demand for telecom services across consumer and enterprise segments, including mobile data, voice, and specialized IoT/B2B connectivity solutions. This supports subscriber growth and potential Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) expansion.\n",
            "*   **Supportive Repo Rate (5.5%):** Reduces borrowing costs for capital-intensive network expansions (e.g., 5G rollout, fiber infrastructure, spectrum payments), enhancing investment viability and enabling faster infrastructure development.\n",
            "*   **Low CPI (3.16%):** Preserves consumer purchasing power, making telecom services more affordable and potentially allowing for better realization of tariff hikes without significant demand destruction.\n",
            "*   **Moderate Brent Crude (6029.25 INR/barrel):** Helps manage operational expenses, particularly related to power consumption for telecom towers and data centers, which are significant cost components.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Unfavorable Indicators:**\n",
            "*   **Elevated Unemployment (7.9%):** Could constrain consumer discretionary spending on telecom services, potentially limiting ARPU growth, hindering premium plan adoption, and increasing price sensitivity among subscribers.\n",
            "*   **Current Account Deficit (-11457) & External Sector Vulnerability:** Signals potential for INR depreciation. This would increase the cost of essential imported network equipment and foreign currency-denominated debt servicing for telcos, impacting profitability and capex budgets.\n",
            "*   **INR (85.45/USD):** A relatively weaker INR raises the cost of essential imported network equipment and foreign debt servicing, impacting operational costs and capital expenditure.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Outlook:**\n",
            "Cautiously positive. The sector is poised for continued growth driven by robust domestic demand and strong manufacturing activity. However, high unemployment and external sector risks warrant careful monitoring of consumer spending trends and potential input cost pressures.\n",
